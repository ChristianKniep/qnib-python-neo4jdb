# qnib-python-neo4jdb

Neo4j adapter for QNIBInventory purposes

## Packaging

`create.sh` uses the most recent `git tag` and the tool `fpm` to generate a rpm file.

Since the package is quite simple structured, the following file will do:
`packaged/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/qnib_neo4jdb/__init__.py`
